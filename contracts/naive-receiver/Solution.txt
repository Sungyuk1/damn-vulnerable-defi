        address token,
        uint256 amount,

1) Notice that anyone can call the flashloan method and that the function does not check that only the reciever can call it. 
2) Anyone can specifiy the address of the receiver that they wish to call it on. 
3) Calling flashLoan with thd recievers contract as the reciver, then calling it with an amount of zero, will cause the user's contract 
   to borrow no money but still have to pay back the really high 1 eth fixed fee
